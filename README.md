# Homework-2
## Description 
In this challenge, I used the skills I've learned thus far to create a portfolio page that allows me to feature and display my projects to potential employers. I want this page to be clean, presentable, and functional. It has links that allow the user to navigate the page and links to bring user to seperate pages that display my work. For now, many of these are placeholders but I can easily add links as I build new projects. It is designed to be responsive on various screen sizes.
